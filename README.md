# LALU
This is the main repo for LALU related things. Eventually it will be cleaned up and stop being such a mess, but this repo contains:
 - The Logisim File
 - The formal Instruction Set Manual (https://github.com/MaliciousFiles/LALU-2.0/blob/main/Assembly.md)
 - The assembler (assembler.py)
 - The current version of LLIR (https://github.com/MaliciousFiles/LALU-2.0/blob/main/LLIR2.py)
 - The verilog files
 - Various assembly files

But if you want to check out LLPC which is the compiler for LALU, see this repo: (https://github.com/CMDRZero/LLPC)
